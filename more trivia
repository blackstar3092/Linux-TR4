The “Madagascar” Penguins Were Originally the Beatles


Alex the lion was the biggest star at the zoo. But the most popular characters to emerge from the “Madagascar” films might just be the four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private. 
They got their very own spin-off movie in 2014. However, it turns out that these four waddling birds were originally drawn for a movie that had nothing to do with the franchise. 
While working on a project called “Rockumentary”, DreamWorks’ animation director Eric Darnell created the penguins as a version of The Beatles. 
However, the music rights were too complicated, and the film never got made. Luckily for us, when ‘Madagascar” needed some penguins, they had the shelved flappy fab four ready to go.
