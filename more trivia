Jerry Seinfeld’s “Bee Movie” Pitch Was a Joke

#i can totally see that

"For most people, getting a movie greenlit requires a whole lot of work and luck. For Jerry Seinfeld, all it took was dinner and a joke. The meal happened to be with Steven Spielberg and the gag gave us the “Bee Movie”. As Seinfeld said during an interview back in 2007, “it was an offhand remark of something I thought might be a funny comment.” He wasn’t actually particularly keen on the idea of making a real motion picture out of it! But clearly flag{Spielberg} thought there was something there. He took the idea to DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, and pretty soon, Barry B. Benson and his pals graced our screens."
